### Project Synopsis  

Over the past year or so Credit One has seen an increase in the number of customers who have defaulted on loans they have secured from various partners, and Credit One, as their credit scoring service, could risk losing business if the problem is not solved right away.

Our goal is to evaluate our data and provide a better method of evaluating credit risk through machine learning

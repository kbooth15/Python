### Project Synopsis  

Our client is developing a system to be deployed on large industrial campuses, in shopping malls, et cetera to help people to navigate a complex, unfamiliar interior space without getting lost. While GPS works fairly reliably outdoors, it generally doesn't work indoors, so a different technology is necessary.  

Our goal is to investigate the feasibility of using "wifi fingerprinting" to determine a person's location in indoor spaces. Wifi fingerprinting uses the signals from multiple wifi hotspots within the building to determine location, analogously to how GPS uses satellite signals.
